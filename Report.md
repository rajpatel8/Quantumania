# Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration Assessment Tool
## Comprehensive Project Report

---

## Executive Summary

The **Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration Assessment Tool** is a sophisticated cybersecurity solution developed by a collaborative six-member team as part of COMP-8677 Advanced Topics in Computer Security coursework at the University of Windsor. This comprehensive tool is designed to identify and assess quantum-vulnerable cryptographic implementations in software codebases. As quantum computing advances towards practical cryptographic attacks, this tool addresses the critical need for organizations to evaluate their cryptographic infrastructure's quantum readiness and plan migration strategies to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards.

---

## Project Overview

### Purpose and Objectives

The primary goal of this collaborative project is to develop an automated scanning tool that identifies quantum-vulnerable cryptographic algorithms (RSA, ECC, DH, weak hashes), assesses quantum risk levels and estimated break timelines, generates comprehensive security reports including CBOM (Cryptographic Bill of Materials), provides NIST-compliant migration recommendations for post-quantum cryptography, and supports multiple programming languages and output formats. This project serves as both a practical cybersecurity solution and a demonstration of advanced software engineering principles applied to emerging security challenges in the quantum computing era.

### Target Problem

With the advent of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic algorithms face unprecedented threats. Shor's Algorithm can break RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman, while Grover's Algorithm reduces effective security of symmetric cryptography. Organizations need to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms before quantum computers become practical.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Multi-Language Cryptographic Detection

The scanner supports comprehensive analysis of Python codebases including Crypto, cryptography, and hashlib libraries. Java support covers java.security and javax.crypto packages with complete pattern recognition. The extensible architecture accommodates additional language modules through modular design patterns.

Pattern recognition identifies specific implementations such as RSA.generate(2048) for Python RSA key generation, KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA") for Java RSA implementation, and ec.generate_private_key() for Python ECC implementation.

### Comprehensive Risk Assessment

The risk assessment system categorizes vulnerabilities into four distinct levels. CRITICAL level includes RSA, ECC, and DH algorithms vulnerable to Shor's Algorithm. HIGH level encompasses MD5 and SHA1 hashes vulnerable to Grover's Algorithm. MEDIUM level covers short symmetric keys with reduced security margins. LOW level identifies quantum-resistant algorithms that maintain security in post-quantum environments.

Timeline estimates project practical quantum computers capable of cryptographic attacks between 2030-2035, with large-scale quantum computing deployment expected in the 2040+ timeframe.
